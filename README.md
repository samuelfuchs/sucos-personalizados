# Sucos Paradise
 
This project was made mainly with HTML & CSS
Some JavaScript was used to edit the Navigation Bar when scrolling up and down.

It is a menu for a restaurant that sells refreshing and healthy drinks. Clients could scan a VR Code to navigate to the menu to see different option to get. 

The restaurant does not exist in real life.
This site is made in Portugues-Brazil
